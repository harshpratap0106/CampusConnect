1. Problem Description

Educational institutions often lack a centralized, digital method for students to report infrastructure, academic, or residential issues. The current manual process (paper forms or emails) is slow, lacks transparency, and makes tracking difficult for administrators.

2. Scope

The project acts as a desktop-based Grievance Redressal System.

In Scope: * User Authentication (Student vs. Admin).

Grievance submission with categorization.

File-based data persistence (No SQL setup required).

Admin controls to update grievance status.

Out of Scope: Mobile app interface, payment gateways.

3. Target Users

Students: To submit complaints and track their resolution status.

Administrators: To view all complaints and mark them as "Resolved" or "In Progress".

4. High-Level Features

Secure Login: Role-based access control.

Data Persistence: Uses localized text files to store data (simulating a database).

Status Tracking: Students can see real-time updates on their dashboard.

GUI: User-friendly Swing interface.
